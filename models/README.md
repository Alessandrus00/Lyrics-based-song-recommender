## Models used in this project
Most of the models will be downloaded and stored on the fly. The only exceptions are large files, for which manual downloading is necessary.
In particular, from the root directory of the project you should lunch:

For the Fast text model (cc.en.300.bin)
```bash
bash download_fasttext.sh
```

For the Universal Sentence Encoder model (transformer-based variant v2)
```bash
bash download_use.sh
```
