[Logic:]
Let me kick rhymes, let me do it slow
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know
See I'm half white and half negro
So I guess that's why I got a big ego
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice
Tryna eat like two dykes cause I'm famished (I'm famished)
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest
And even when I'm fed I'mma keep going 'til the death
Call me the collar bomba cause I'm blowing minds
Like Osama, that's word to Obama
So much action within my words there ain't no time for drama
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama you ain't heard

[C Dot Castro:]
My name is Castro
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco
I'm the shit, never constipated I got mad flow
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?
I don't know even my homies say I'm an asshole
My style is so defined cause I'm the definition
Of truth you want proof well then you better listen
I'm never dissin' that's a waste of time
Why waste an amazing rhyme
On them when I can take it and make it mine
I'll make it fine, homie I don't need no one's help
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt
Yeah, my flow is presidential
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental
So try to sleep on me, I leave you like Tom in Seattle
My wordplay is too vicious homie
So you don't wanna scrabble, you don't wanna battle
My shit will leave you without a paddle
Now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle

[Logic:]
My wifey livin' like Oprah
Matter of fact Princess Diana
Cause my first name is S-I-R
And I don't live like no bama
See I execute my emotion through perpetual grammar
Cause my stamina colder than Canada
And hotter than Hades
I spit more than babies infected with rabies
They can't get over the fact
That I'm under their skin like scabies, what it do

We gon' Switch it up like this

[Logic:]
Uh, now, I'm off the hook, so none of y'all can debate it
Started making music, cause I never really related
To this bullshit, that they spit, claiming that they made it
Similar to a eight guard, cause I can't fade it
Use your logic, you could never evade it
I'm kinda like the Young Sinatra, mixed with Sammy Davis Jr
Already knowing they are, two of the best to ever to do it
Rhyming to improve and take rap
And move it in another direction, spread like infection
Better yet, lice, cause I'm always on their mind
I'm a breed of different kind, yes
I'm ahead of my time when it comes to the rhyme

[Logic:]
You can catch me in the booth, from dusk, 'til the sun up
That Super Mario flow, I always get the one up
Yeah, we gun up, laser gotta help me run up [gun shots]
Not really, but it sounded tight, shut up
Fuck around, steal your bitch, just to get the nut up
Really, what up? With everybody looking for a deal
You can call me Indy-ana Jones and I'm headed for the throne
Going on a M.J. beat, leave me alone, this is music
Who are you to tell me how to use it?
Never confuse it, originality, I'll never lose it
Maybe I'm a little psycho, for hopping on the beat
But the logical part of me, telling me, you're feeling B
See? I'm a lyrical entity, blowing minds like Kennedy
With controversial lines, so everybody remember me
I'm repping Maryland, if you bite
I'll snap on you, like a Terrapin
Flyer than an airplane
I'm just fucking around
Switch it up with various styles, just to keep you around

[Michael Jackson:]
Some people are entertainers and some people are great entertainers
Some people are followers and some people make the path and are pioneers

What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love
Or near enough
I gotta tell you the truthâ¦

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it
