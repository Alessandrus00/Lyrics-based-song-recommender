I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me
Must've 'bin blind 

She didn't give me a warning 
Said I shouldn't treat you wrong 
But when I woke up this mornin' 
She was gone gone gone 

She said... 
Take me back won't ya
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

She didn't tell me about it 
Am I supposed to read your mind 
You make me get up and shout it 
It's a crime crime crime 

I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me 
Must've 'bin blind 

She said...
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

Won't ya take me back 
Won't ya take me back

I cannot find a way to describe it
It's there inside; all I do is hide
I wish that it would just go away
What would you do, you do if you knew?
What would you do?

All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable; come and take me away

I feel like I am all alone
All by myself I need to get around this
My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you
If I show you, I don't think you'd understand
'Cause no one understands

All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable; come and take me away

I'm going nowhere, on and on, and
I'm getting nowhere, on and on, and on
Take me away
I'm going nowhere, on and off, and off, and on, and off, and on

All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
I'm unable; come and take me away

Take me away
Break me away
Take me away

She was gone,
Long gone this morning,
She left a note
Said I'm out of here adios my dear
And that was all she wrote

I tried to hang but the Hank wasn't tough enough
Couldn't twang the pain with the Flatt & Scruggs
Had to keep on drinking,
Keep on sinking down, down,
Down, down, down to the good stuff

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a Marshall stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Got a Cali chick, checking out this hick
Spinning that Back In Black
I hit rock bottom,
Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back,

She's flying high tonight,
Just across town
This ole hillbilly playing Stardust Willy
Wasn't even getting off the ground

Tried to hang with the Hank but I had to stop
Got sad when the J Cash needle dropped
Couldn't walk the line
So I just kept shining down, down
Down, down, down that juke box

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a Marshall stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Got a Cali chick, checking out this hick
Spinning that Back In Black
I hit rock bottom,
Started bouncing back

'Til I hit rock bottom, and I cranked it up
I hit that water back with a Marshall stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Got a Cali chick, checking out this hick
Spinning that Back In Black
I hit rock bottom
Started bouncing back
Started bouncing back
