Here is a little story that I made up
So Let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
that was too much fun for me
Boy there's a sexy guy 
He said he'd give me everything i need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far
and get the best of me
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
The conversation was going no where 'til I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differantly
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just begun
I just begun
having my fun
I just begun 
Having my fun, yeah!

I'm talking to the mirror again but it's not listening
I'm cleaning my dirty mind like a toilet but it won't give in
I'm drinking spirits in the hopes that I will find myself one
But all I can rectify is that the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

I feel like falling asleep and never waking up
It's not that my glass is empty but I need another cup
When all of the doors around me just shut one by one
I feel like falling asleep but the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

Shaky shaky steps in the middle of the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Of limbs and tooth under my skin
Oh, freedom, where do I begin
I'm changing my inflection and how I say the words
Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard
Oh, death of the party
I picked up the chalice of malice
And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full
I was thirsty but I drank till I was full, 
I drank till I, till I,till I was full

There's a fever in my bones that I know so well
I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
I'm cleaning up as fast as I can
Cuz you can't unbreak what you break, you can't unfake the very fake
You cannot fuel without a tank, 
no you can't unbreak what you break, what you break

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.

Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.

My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.
