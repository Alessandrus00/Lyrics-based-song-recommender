She hit me like a blinding light and I was born
And gravity won't keep my feet down anymore
If you've seen her then you'd understand

An angel in my, the way she moves
She could make your heart beat faster than you knew
She's got a smile that can shake you, vibe that can break you
Eyes that can bring the heat
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(There's just one thing that I haven't told her)

Well, I've been holding back so much I'm in reverse
And buying her that drugstore diamond made it worse
Like the silver on her skin stood for something; a promise

I don't wanna burn out quick if she's the one
Like the fire in between a bullet and the gun
Because she's brighter than Vegas, hotter than Hades
Cool enough to make you freeze
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
I don't wanna lose her
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

Do you know what you do to me?
I've been captured, waiting for the rapture
Am I just a fool to believe this is it, this is it?

So tell me that you feel the same
Can we say what we wanna say?
'Cause there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
But I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)

She hit me like a blinding light and I was born

Now tell me how you feel if I told 
You that I have feelings for you 
Ansd would it be so wrong to say 
What's on my mind 
I'm sorry I have to
We were friends but with time 
What I feel inside for you has changed 
But I'd give up on love, if I thought 
That it was untrue for you

(If I told you that) I wanted to see you 
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you 
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you 
What would you say (if I told you that)

I know that we were just friends 
But what if I decide to bring somethings in 
I hope it won't offend the trust 
We have cause I don't want this to end
I you think that we'll lose what we have 
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same 
(I'd rather stay the same) 
Cause I don't wanna choose 
Between two of the most precious things to me 
(tell me)

(If I told you that) I wanted to see you 
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you 
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you 
What would you say (if I told you that)

If we take this chance and extend 
To each other romance 
I hope it would be 
The right thing for you and me

(If I told you that) I wanted to see you 
(And if I told you that) I beg to please you 
(If I told you that) I'll always keep you 
What would you say (if I told you that)

Would you be there for me 
Could you dare to hold me 
Will my feelings leave me 
Lonely if I told you

The news it came out in the First World War
The bloody Red Baron was flying once more
The Allied Command ignored all of its men
And called on Snoopy to do it again

It was the night before Christmas and forty below
When Snoopy went up in search of his foe
He spied the Red Baron and fiercely they fought
With ice on his wings, snoopy knew he was caught

Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ring out from the land
Asking peace of all the world
And goodwill to man

The Baron had Snoopy dead in his sights
He reached for the trigger to pull it up tight
Why he didn't shoot, well, we'll never know
Or was it the bells from the village below

Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And goodwill to man

The Baron made Snoopy fly to the Rhine
And forced him to land behind the enemy lines
Snoopy was certain that this was the end
When the Baron cried out, ""Merry Christmas, my friend!""

The Baron then offered a holiday toast
And Snoopy our hero saluted his host
And then with a roar they were both on their way
Each knowing they'd meet on some other day

Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And goodwill to man

Christmas bells those Christmas bells
Ringing through the land
Bringing peace to all the world
And goodwill to man
And goodwill to man
And goodwill to man
