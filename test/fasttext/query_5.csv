Here is a little story that I made up
So Let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
that was too much fun for me
Boy there's a sexy guy 
He said he'd give me everything i need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far
and get the best of me
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
The conversation was going no where 'til I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differantly
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just begun
I just begun
having my fun
I just begun 
Having my fun, yeah!

I've seen a man cry, I've seen a man die inside
I've seen him say to me that he is only mine
That he gotta do what is best for him
Never let me in, not even begin
To tell me I'm the one under his moon and sun
That I am the thing that revolves around him
But while on top of him I know what's best for him
I'll show him how to win and let me in 'cause

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be your baby girl
I don't wanna be your little pearl
I just wanna be what's best for me
To be winding down with my own star under my own sun

We're all sorry now, I didn't mean to wow
Make you cry like that, it's just a little spat
Still I want you to know, though I love you so
It's mostly me dreaming, forcing, believing
That you're an ideal, hell I never steal
But I stole you from, from another one
So take yourself and wrap around my little finger
'cause that's how it should swing

[Chorus]

Why can't he see, why can't he see what's inside of me, yeah...
don't you, don't you call me coochie-coo a little girl, now...
don't you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now I'm so much more,
can't you see? Can't you see?
Look who's writing now a token of their love
Can't you see love that it's just because
I wanted a cheap way to get inside your head
And not a cheap way to get inside your bed
Oh you're running now, with that silly one
It's all over now, this woman's just begun
Maybe we'll see about the will and the way
Butterflies return some day

[Chorus]

I can see the sun shinin' down on me
Is it you my love that I can see
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me walk to Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
to Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

In this my life , I walk in light
You are my love so baby I'm all right
Don't let me down , baby
Don't let me down
Oh baby, please don't let me walk in Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
in Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

Ah....

Ev'ry man alive has got to have someone
So what will I do when baby you are gone
Don't let me down
Don't walk on me
My Sunday sunshine
hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Monday's rain (Monday's rain) Ah...
