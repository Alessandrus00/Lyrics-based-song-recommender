Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day)...

Block don't stop, always stay hot
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock, then I got popped
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay
It's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
The night they blast my cousin, whoa
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

Been a long day...
On my way to my holy place to pray...
Give thanks for every blessing given to me...
I know there's more to see...more to me...no more living in misery...
Cause this is how I visioned life to beee.....

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go...
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

Yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.
You would've liked it. I-I know you all too well.
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.
You can stay but shawty here I go...

[Verse 1]
Uh, should I spend the weekend in Vegas? 
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it. 
I mean, how could I forget? My memories never faded.
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it. 
I am, still here with who I started with.
The game needed life, I put my heart in it.
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit. 
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.
Uh. I'm 23, with a money tree.
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds.
It's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,
and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.
It's happening Penny Lane, just like you said.
I avoided the Coke game, and went with Sprite instead.
Uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.
I'm trying to do better than good enough.

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)
You promised me you would never change.
You promised me you would never change. 

[Verse 2]
Uh. Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on.
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on.
Now that I'm on, I don't really want to worry about getting back on.
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone.
But hit redial you see that I just called, some chick I met at the mall,
that I barley know at all and..
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it.
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holding on by a thread it's..
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now,
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of? This is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
But people I don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)
You promised me you would never change.
You promised you would never change. 

[Verse 3]
Well all right. Uh. I live by some advices, girl Lisa told me.
The other day, Lisa told that she missed the old me.
Which made me question when I went missing.
And when I start treating my friends different.
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up.
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up.
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up.
Or the fact I haven't seen em since they locked Big Rich up.
I know. At the same time I'm quick to forget.
I'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets. 
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh.
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed.
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?
I just need some closure. 
Aint no turning back for me I'm in till it's over.

I'll have a blue blue Christmas

I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

A blue blue Christmas without you
