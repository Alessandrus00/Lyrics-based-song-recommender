She hit me like a blinding light and I was born
And gravity won't keep my feet down anymore
If you've seen her then you'd understand

An angel in my, the way she moves
She could make your heart beat faster than you knew
She's got a smile that can shake you, vibe that can break you
Eyes that can bring the heat
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(There's just one thing that I haven't told her)

Well, I've been holding back so much I'm in reverse
And buying her that drugstore diamond made it worse
Like the silver on her skin stood for something; a promise

I don't wanna burn out quick if she's the one
Like the fire in between a bullet and the gun
Because she's brighter than Vegas, hotter than Hades
Cool enough to make you freeze
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
I don't wanna lose her
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

Do you know what you do to me?
I've been captured, waiting for the rapture
Am I just a fool to believe this is it, this is it?

So tell me that you feel the same
Can we say what we wanna say?
'Cause there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
But I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)

She hit me like a blinding light and I was born

You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
You're like oh well
You're like fuck it oh well
My past behind me like a pony tail

But you're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

OK I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank God that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more henny and you're past the limit
You told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

[2x:]
You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

Tangerine she is all they claim
With her eyes of night lips as bright as flame
Tangerine when she dances by
Senoritas stare, caballeros sigh

And I sing toast to Tangerine
Raising every bar across the Argentine
Yes she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Yes she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

(Tangerine) Tangerine (Tangerine) Tangerine (Tangerine) Tangerine
