I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me
Must've 'bin blind 

She didn't give me a warning 
Said I shouldn't treat you wrong 
But when I woke up this mornin' 
She was gone gone gone 

She said... 
Take me back won't ya
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

She didn't tell me about it 
Am I supposed to read your mind 
You make me get up and shout it 
It's a crime crime crime 

I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me 
Must've 'bin blind 

She said...
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

Won't ya take me back 
Won't ya take me back

Say yes
My mama always said, ""Life's better when you say yes""
All that you can do is dare to do your best
When your hand is on your heart, and it's beating out your chest
You know you're blessed

She said, ""I don't wanna feel like sitting down
Feels like both my feet are stuck to the ground
Every day, I get a little more left out
But it don't get me down
No, it don't get me down""

'Cause I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster

Say no
My daddy always said, ""Don't sweat it when they say no""
There's so much more to you than you will ever know
Hold on to your dreams, don't ever let them go-o-o
It's your show

She said, ""I don't wanna feel like sitting down
Feels like both my feet are stuck to the ground
Every day, I get a little more left out
But it don't get me down
No, it don't get me down""

'Cause I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster

Some times my face ain't the face I remember it being
But I'm the same kid that I used to be

No, I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster
'Cause I'm not getting any younger (Oh no)
Some new kids tryna steal my thunder (Oh no)
But I would never take it back, take it back
Take it back, take it back to the start
'Cause in my heart, I'm still a youngster

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (yeah-yeah)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

I hear those jingle bells
On this midnight clear
Hark the herald angels sing
Soon Santa will be here
All I want for Christmas
Is a silent night with you
And a frosty morning snow so we can go
On a sleigh ride just for two

Have a very Merry Christmas Day
And a Happy New Year too
Thank you for the love you give
My greatest gift is you

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

Have a very Merry Christmas Day
And a Happy New Year too
Thank you for the love you give
My greatest gift is you

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, I love you

When I count my blessings
You're the first one on my list
And when I feel a little lonely
You're the only one I miss

You make life a holiday
It's like magic when you do
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
I love you

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (yeah, yeah)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (dont't wanna live without you)
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas (baby)
