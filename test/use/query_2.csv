Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day)...

Block don't stop, always stay hot
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock, then I got popped
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay
It's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
The night they blast my cousin, whoa
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

Been a long day...
On my way to my holy place to pray...
Give thanks for every blessing given to me...
I know there's more to see...more to me...no more living in misery...
Cause this is how I visioned life to beee.....

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go...
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto-living

These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it you'll keep going down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out

You keep on falling
And no one can hear you calling
So you end up self-destructing

On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine

'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holding on to what God gave me

'Cause that's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
And eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto
'Cause that's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
And eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

No need to cherish luxuries
'Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
'Cause you're not promised tomorrow

So live your life as if every day's gon' be your last
Once you move forward can't go back
Best prepare to remove your past

'Cause you gotta be willing to pray
Yes there gotta be, yeah, gotta be a better way
Yes you gotta be willing to pray
'Cause there gotta be, yeah, gotta be a better day

Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growing up with AIDS

'Cause that's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto
That's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

Gun shots every night
In the ghetto
Crooked cops on sight
In the ghetto
Every day is a fight
In the ghetto, ghetto
Got kids to feed
In the ghetto
Selling coke and weed
In the ghetto
Every day somebody bleed
In the ghetto, ghetto

That's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or living by the ghetto
Or eating in the ghetto, ghetto
That's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto
Living in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
