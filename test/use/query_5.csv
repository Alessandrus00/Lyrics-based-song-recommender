Here is a little story that I made up
So Let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
that was too much fun for me
Boy there's a sexy guy 
He said he'd give me everything i need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far
and get the best of me
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
The conversation was going no where 'til I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differantly
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just begun
I just begun
having my fun
I just begun 
Having my fun, yeah!

What is that that you're looking through 
a pornographic magazine?
When I bet you don't even know how to
spell the word
And you say you don't leave home unless
you're strapped
With your uzi sub machine
When you've just barely come into this world
Well, if a child's ways and actions
Reflect what they hear and see
Guess the only ones to blame are you and me

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world 
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

What kind of name is that you're calling her
I've heard that word before
But I don't think any parent would give their
daughter a name so low
And about this extra paraphernalia
You say you're carrying to get high

That won't take you anywhere you want to go
Well, you don't have to listen
Cause it's here for you to see
So many burnt out lives trapped in their misery

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

Oh, I could rattle on about the good old days
And how life used to be
And even inwardly relive them vividly
But the best advice I can give to you
Is that we only go around one time
Treat each day like this is it
And give it the best you can

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
The only chance for a better one
Is up to you and he
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Look what's happened to our world
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
We're so sorry
There's so much we should and should
have never done
That's why we're beggin' on our knees
Please! Forgive us for what we've done
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones
Ms. & Mr. Little Ones

[Wale]
This is the fun part, no what Iâm saying?

[Wale]
Seen the highs and lows, remember when I was broke
Trying to shower with soap, roaches all in the soap
Now Iâm killing these shows, I just deliver the hope
These women give you their heart, these bitches give me they throat
These bitches give me their mind all the time let a way to break it down
Never tell em bend over I just make emâ take a bow
Stepping out fly shit, straight purple cloud shit
Roll the whole mountain, now Iâm on the couch bent
Okay DMV shit but they know me out in PA
Scooping out hoes at the Oâs out in PA
HAHA okay my flow is on that freebase
Louboutin sneakers I suppose I can relay
Mac Miller my little nigga, real nigga
PA skillin we on a roll like thick strippers
You still sleepin, you canât see em, we still beefin
We still rolling, we still blowing, we still achieving
Iâm still killing, still winning, we still Sheenâing
Iâm Ricky Vaughn on the song, why you still swinging?
Why you lil niggas still swinging? Got virgin tight flows still bleeding

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Maybe good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, Iâm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck.
[Wale]
My nigga good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, Iâm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck.

[Mac Miller]
I ain't give a fuck, I hear em talking I donât listen Iâm up-
In the clouds looking down, I ain't even in a rush
I been laughed at, hated on, no one would even play my songs
Wouldnât even listen to anything that my name was on
Itâs so hard and its so an this marvelous flow
Cause as hard as I go I know that I canât stop wont stop
I love what I do, you donât even know yourself how we fucking with you?
I ain't got time for all the problems, no I never did my trig
smile on my face got me feeling like the shit
Bill Clinton pimping, always with a monica
Days Inn.. turn that shit to hotel erotica
Marijuana for everybody in yamakas
I donât give a fuck till my homies put some bottles up
And talking shit we gonâ party all day, when Iâm in the DMV I hit the home Wale
Hit strip clubs find bitches with big butts
I donât give a fuck Iâm getting drunk, only live once
Young and dumb as hell, something something something something fuck it

[Hook: Wale]
My nigga good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, Iâm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck.
[Mac Miller]
Maybe good shit happens, so what if it does?
Baby the worst gonna come, sow what if it does?
It ain't nothing to me, Iâm who they comming to see
So I ain't giving a fuck.
