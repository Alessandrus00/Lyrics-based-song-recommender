She hit me like a blinding light and I was born
And gravity won't keep my feet down anymore
If you've seen her then you'd understand

An angel in my, the way she moves
She could make your heart beat faster than you knew
She's got a smile that can shake you, vibe that can break you
Eyes that can bring the heat
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(There's just one thing that I haven't told her)

Well, I've been holding back so much I'm in reverse
And buying her that drugstore diamond made it worse
Like the silver on her skin stood for something; a promise

I don't wanna burn out quick if she's the one
Like the fire in between a bullet and the gun
Because she's brighter than Vegas, hotter than Hades
Cool enough to make you freeze
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
I don't wanna lose her
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

Do you know what you do to me?
I've been captured, waiting for the rapture
Am I just a fool to believe this is it, this is it?

So tell me that you feel the same
Can we say what we wanna say?
'Cause there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
But I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)

She hit me like a blinding light and I was born

Drifting apart, getting harder to hold you
Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?
Swept out of sight, rolling up on an ocean
Let's cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive, maybe then they might
Send us back to the sun

Now I know, I know
That we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire

Head down, heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Streets are alive now, and everything's bracing
You're on my mind, running in my veins fueling the flame
Let's start it again

And I know, I know
That we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire, fire
We were on fire, fire

Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa-oh-oh, now don't tell me no
That we're burning down
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa-oh-oh, now don't tell me no
That we're burning now

I know, I know we're losing light and our love is dying
Take me, take me home
Back to where we was before when we were on fire, fire
And I know, I know that we're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before when we were on fire, fire
When we were on fire, fire.

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Shorty I got more money than I ever had
But you the only thing I need right now 
You make it all so simple, you my new thing
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I fuck her like an addict, she fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though, I flew out Aneisha just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
Saw my grin on my cars on my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio this shit's a nigga tempo
Fat boy blue jeans and a gold watch
Started at the bottom then she rolled on top
Black testerosa, zero to sixty on the strip she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai, Emirates live flew in with 1.5
Never fold is the threshold, like my mother sayin now never let go
Hood nigga with a escrow, bad bitch but she special
Went home and I prayed for a angel appeared in the dark here to take away the pain too
War wombs on the big dog, but she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade got two seats, got her everything but the blue beach
Cartier wings nigga two seats, nigga gettin money like a new Meech
We the knights of the Templar, dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole clique another Enron, baby girl it's time for you to get gone
Here's a shoulder just to lean on, Rozay baby and the team strong

[Verse 2: Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Chorus: Drake]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
I know exactly who you could be...
Just hold on, we're going home...
Just hold on, we're going home...
It's hard to do these things alone...
Just hold on, we're go-ing home, ohh-ohh oh ohhhh..

[Verse 3: Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Chorus: Drake (Majid Jordan)]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (ohh yeah)
You act so different around me (la-da dah daaah)
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (la-da dah)
I know exactly who you could be...
So just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home) ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)

[Interlude 2X: Majid Jordan]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you every.. thing I loved
I think there's something... baby
I think there's something... baby

[Chorus: Drake (Majid Jordan)]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
(Cause you're a good girl and you know it...)
(I know exactly who you could be...)
Ohh, just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home) ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)
