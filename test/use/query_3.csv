[Logic:]
Let me kick rhymes, let me do it slow
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know
See I'm half white and half negro
So I guess that's why I got a big ego
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice
Tryna eat like two dykes cause I'm famished (I'm famished)
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest
And even when I'm fed I'mma keep going 'til the death
Call me the collar bomba cause I'm blowing minds
Like Osama, that's word to Obama
So much action within my words there ain't no time for drama
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama you ain't heard

[C Dot Castro:]
My name is Castro
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco
I'm the shit, never constipated I got mad flow
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?
I don't know even my homies say I'm an asshole
My style is so defined cause I'm the definition
Of truth you want proof well then you better listen
I'm never dissin' that's a waste of time
Why waste an amazing rhyme
On them when I can take it and make it mine
I'll make it fine, homie I don't need no one's help
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt
Yeah, my flow is presidential
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental
So try to sleep on me, I leave you like Tom in Seattle
My wordplay is too vicious homie
So you don't wanna scrabble, you don't wanna battle
My shit will leave you without a paddle
Now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle

[Logic:]
My wifey livin' like Oprah
Matter of fact Princess Diana
Cause my first name is S-I-R
And I don't live like no bama
See I execute my emotion through perpetual grammar
Cause my stamina colder than Canada
And hotter than Hades
I spit more than babies infected with rabies
They can't get over the fact
That I'm under their skin like scabies, what it do

(Hey) The mental state of a lyricist in his prime
Spittin' rhyme, thought from the mind
Poetic rhetoric that rhyme
We punch lines that leave you conflicted, and hit rewind
Every time I spit an I'll line the worlds mine

Fuck a Matana
Quit it the second I'm out the vagina
Won't even call her maÃ±ana
Sike

Lyrical Unibomber
I'm a I'm a allergic to drama
Mentality of a felon
Rebellin' elevate
While you repellin'
Only hate because I'm sellin'
Who you tellin'?

See I was on that raw shit
While you was on that naw shit
The people ""they gonna toss it""
When that all they endorse it

I just waited for my time to shine, I never forced it
Strategically planned it like Peyton Mannin' way before shit was even real

I remember nights as a child with my momma, hungry
But my hunger for this music is on another level
This shit will truly have you contemplatin' deals with the devil
But homie I'm a king not a pawn I never settle
Cause this joint within my mind
Is so fine I can bend metal

Yeah, In high school I wasn't worried about them A's and B's
I was trying to make the flow unkillable to obtain these Gs
Murder syllables, yes I aim to please, so much ice they call me Mr. Freeze
Sike
All up under your girls skirt as if I was the breeze
Flow celsius I surpass degrees
Homie, please
And now I'm feelin' like I'm number 1
Cause nobody made it in the game out of where I'm coming from
Can you feel me?

Me and my team devised a scheme to get the cream
Followin' dreams, livin' our lives like movie scenes
It started as a team, sippin' liquor, smoking' green
For music I was a fiend, my homies know what I mean

Ha, Lethal projectiles aimed at reptiles
Best get your money in order fore' you get checked now

(Yeah) The beats my bitch, the mic's my mistress
Fiance flowin' I engage, don't miss this now
Hop on the track, you know I kill it to death
Fuckin' with Logic, it's inevitable that I will result in your imminent death
Now hit rewind and take a breath, Homie ain't nothin' left
I'm Gregory House and this game is testin' my patients
Been on the low like freemasons
Livin' amazing, if your shit is hot my shit is cajun
Divine white wine flowin', yes you know it's aging
You got sixteens? Ha, I got mathematical equations

Too many teardrops for one heart to be cryinâ (I just canât stand it)
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on, yest it is (I just canât stand it)
Youâre way on top now, baby, since you left me, yeah
And youâre always laughinâ down at me, yes sir

But, o-o-o-oh, watch out baby, Iâm gonna get there, yeah
And weâll be together in just a little while, yes we will
And weâll be gathering tears from way up here, oh yeah
I wanna see you cry, yeah, 96 tears, yes I do (96, it just wonât do)

Iâll be on top, and youâll be there just lookinâ up
I can always get up here, and I might not be waving down
Cry baby, cry baby
96 tears (96)
96 tears (96)
96 tears, Lord it just wonât do (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

Ooh, try to get a hundred baby (96, it just wonât do)
96 teardrops from you (96, it just wonât do)
Oh oh, can you get a hundred, baby? yeah (can you make your tears one hundred?)
96 teardrops from you, ooo, ah, ooo, ah, ooo (can you get a million, baby?)
Get a million, yeah, yeah (96, it just wonât do)
Can you get a million tears together? (can you make your tears one hundred?)
From 96 tears, oh baby (can you get a million, baby?)
âCause baby there ainât just wonât do (96, it just wonât do)
Ooo, just wonât, ooo, do, baby (can you make your tears one hundred?)
