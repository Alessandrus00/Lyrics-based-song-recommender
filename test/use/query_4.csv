I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me
Must've 'bin blind 

She didn't give me a warning 
Said I shouldn't treat you wrong 
But when I woke up this mornin' 
She was gone gone gone 

She said... 
Take me back won't ya
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

She didn't tell me about it 
Am I supposed to read your mind 
You make me get up and shout it 
It's a crime crime crime 

I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me 
Must've 'bin blind 

She said...
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

Won't ya take me back 
Won't ya take me back

I've been down - I've been beat
I've been so tired-that I could not speak
I've been so lost thatt I could not see
I wanted things that were out of reach
then I found you and you helped me through
and ya showed me what to do
And that's why I'm comin' back to you...

[Chorus:]
Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
that's how your love will take me home back to you
And if I wish upon that star - someday I'll be where you are 
I know that day is coming soon - ya, I'm coming back to you.
You've been alone, but ya did not show it
You've been in pain, but did not know it
Let me do what I needed to - you were there when I needed you
Mighta let you down, mighta messed you round
but ya never changed your point of view
and that's why I'm comin' back to you...

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
That day is coming soon

I'm coming back to you

From the top of Sinai,
to the Sea of Galilee,
Every hill and plain is home,
Every place is dear to me.

There the breezes tell the stories,
Oh, what stories they do tell,
Of the mighty things that happened,
In the Land of Israel.

Here, where Moses and the prophets,
Spoke of One who would be king,
Of a Heavenly Messiah,
And the blessings He would bring.

Oh, to hear the call again,
""All is peaceful, all is well"",
Upon every rock and mountain,
In the land of Israel.
