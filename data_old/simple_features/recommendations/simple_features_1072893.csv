We are drawn to the light
We will never be saved

The sun without the eye
Existence is atoms and the void
Head in the sand
We bury our problems with our head in our hands
The world is covered with demons
And the eye sees everything

There is no end
There is only pretend
You are decay
I let you in
You rotted away
There is no end
There is only pretend
You are decay
I let you in
You rotted away
This is your nuclear warfare
This is your scared to death
This is the grief of the world resting heavy on your weakling chest
This is your plague and famine
This is your death disease
This is the pain of the world dying on her fucking knees

I am your pain and heartache
I am your up at night
I am everything you hate about your fucking life
I am your nervous breakdown
I am crushed hopes and dreams
I am the life inside you dying on its fucking knees

I cannot live
I refuse to die
I exist
I survive
As the leaves may fall and the dust may rise
So that someday soon even death may die
Death may die"
