You won't want to do it
But you made me a promise
I'm holding you to it

If you get too close
You're gonna get burned
If you get too close
You'll see the tables have turned

Don't come looking for me
I'll come looking for you

I had a dream about you
Just the other night
Your hair was braided
I know you really hated it

Walking down the sidewalk
You better take cover
Don't step on a crack
If you love your mother
You phoned me from the highway
Said you'd be here Friday
I was waiting in the driveway

All my friends have left me
To go to other cities
I'm looking for some pity

You phoned me from the highway
You said you'd be here Friday
I was waiting in your driveway
And you didn't show up"
755950,-0.4519612780202825,"Yes when I was a child
This country seemed so nice
Everyday to laugh and play
Didn't see the fucking lies
Everyday to laugh and play
Didn't see the fucking lies
But I am older now
I see things through different eyes
The power of police
The justice in this land
The court will decide
By the money in my hand
Yes the court will decide
By the money in my hand
Cause money rules this world
Yes I know you understand

Refrain:
No I can't love this country anymore
Too many of us were beaten by the law
And I don't want to die in another German war
No I can't love this country anymore
The life of a politician
The life of your pet
Ranks higher than of stranger
Ranks higher than of a black
Yes the life of a politician
Means more than of a black
The police turn away
And the right wing attack
A blue helmet on your head
A change in the law
They will take any reason
To start another war
We are strong enough again
To fight another German war
Blowin' flags, marching feet
And the crowd starts to roar"
