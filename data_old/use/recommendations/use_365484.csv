Tell me, can you see
See the walls through me?
'Cause how could a love so crazy be, oh, so easy to ignore?

[Chorus]
Hollow, heavy eyes, woah-woah
Follow in your light, woah-woah
I'm a ghost tonight, woah-oh-oh, woah
Woah-oh-oh, woah

[Verse]
The starry night is clear
Can you feel me near?
Under the bed, I disappear
Like a secret that you know
Some wounds never mend
Lilies bloom and bend
White as teeth, I swim beneath the footsteps in the hall

[Chorus]
My hollow, heavy eyes, woah-woah
Follow in your light, woah-woah
I'm a ghost tonight, woah-oh-oh, woah
Woah-oh-oh, woah
[Bridge]
Yeah, 'cause my heart is a stone
Until you make it right
I could live forever, forever, forever, forever
So tell me, can you see
See the walls through me?

[Chorus]
Hollow, heavy eyes, woah-woah
Follow in your light, woah-woah
I'm a ghost tonight, woah-oh-oh, woah

[Bridge]
Oh, no, no, no
'Cause my heart is a stone
Until you make it right
I could live forever, forever, forever, forever

[Outro]
So tell me, can you see
See the walls through me?
'Cause how could a love so crazy be, oh, so easy to ignore?"

I've had my many reasons
To take the words out of your breath
The blood right from your veins, and I
Tried to remember what life was like without you
But it never seems to let me forget

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And will you wait on the edge?
And will you wait for me to catch you?

[Chorus]
Through no faults of your own you're bleeding
Do you remember what you want?
I'm so alone with loss and doubts of my own
If you need me, I will be here when you want

[Verse 2]
She had her ways of leaving
She touched her hair then touched his face
Wiped the water from his eyes, and I
Try to picture what life is like without you
But you never seem to let me forget
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And will you wait at the end?
And will you wait for me to catch up?

[Chorus]
Through no faults of your own you're bleeding
Do you remember what you want?
I'm so alone with loss and doubts of my own
If you need me, I will be here when you want

[Bridge]
She says that we're still here
And she says that we're here still
Reassembling the icons, one piece at a time
And we're still here
Dismantling the eyesores, one day at a time
And we're crushing ourselves
One day at a time
One day at a time
One day

[Chorus]
Through no faults of your own you're bleeding
Do you remember what you want?
I'm so alone with loss and doubts of my own
If you need me, I will be here when you want
[Post-Chorus]
Reassembling the icons, oh no
Reassembling the icons, oh no
Reassembling!

[Outro]
I will be here when you want
Reassembling the icons"
