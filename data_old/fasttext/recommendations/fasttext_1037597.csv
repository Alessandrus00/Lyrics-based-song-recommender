My life is all about riches and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Want me to put you on, keep wishing
You need to learn the rules and conditions
It's facts that you missing
Sit back and takes notes man and listen
First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The C.R.E.A.M. will have you shittin' on your people
Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm making figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of TECs, and Amacuras
Kid you get your cap peeled backwards
For years I been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Living life to the fullest
My story ends with a bullet
'Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
We trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes another part of my team dies
I could still hear his voice while he up in the skies
While the rest still living steady telling me lies
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up
[Verse 2: Havoc]
I got to get mines no matter what the consequences
Count on my blessings add up my weapons
Cock back the nine let my heat serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend service
Try and make mill to stretch you know the deal
So we sling krill, get your cap peeled cause everything is real
But I want to chill laid up in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
You get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed watch you drop in less than ten
On the road to the riches
Hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try you sound sloppy
You want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
The theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury
Pushing fat whips and living comfortably

[Refrain: Prodigy]
It's all about the riches and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Lifestyles of the infamous
It's all about the riches and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Lifestyles of the infamous
[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Too much dough to get, for one man to handle
Started from the bottom, went further than I planned to
It’s a whole new world and my team is on
That’s why your crew and mine’s can’t get along
But it ain’t no thing to me
If I die, just bury me with a bottle of Hennessy
And I’ll be alright but I ain’t droppin’ no time soon
‘Cos before you clap me, I’ma clap you
If I offend you, so the fuck what?
If you ain’t bustin’ yo gat, shut the fuck up
'Cos one less nigga just more money circulating
More clientele to keep my pager percolating
Some bust me, don’t discuss me, trust me
Niggas trynna thump me but got lump very roughly
Then we boatin’ in the three quarter
Across the water, Queensbridge is just around the corner
Well, you can find me at the store spending my rent
Getting bent, drink Dainy and save 20 cent
Find a bitch, take her upstairs and bend her over
The same every day ‘till my life’s all over"

Tearin' up the chicks with the message that he lays down

Who is the coolest guy, that is what I am
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam

Chicks are makin' reservations for his lovin' so fine
Screamin' and afraid that he has got 'em all waitin' in a line

Who is the coolest guy, that is what I am
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam

Chicks are makin' reservations for his lovin' so fine
Screamin' and afraid that he has got 'em all waitin' in a line

Who is the coolest guy, that is what I am
