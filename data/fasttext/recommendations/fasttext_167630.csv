Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon the Rocks,
Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow Rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of Roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;
A belt of straw and Ivy buds,
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

The Shepherdsâ€™ Swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me, and be my love.

You go into the Wimpy but that's your BIG mistake, by the time you leave you've got a stomach ache

Wimpy's are shit (Trapper: So are M********), Wimpy's are shit (Trapper: I hate Ronald), Wimpy's are shit

You get served by a tart dressed in orange and black, when you see your food you wanna send it back
You look at the pictures of the Wimpy's on the wall, but what you get given is hardly edible

Wimpy's are shit (Trapper: Meat means murder), Wimpy's are shit (Trapper: Don't' buy a burger), Wimpy's are shit

Get served your food and it's always cold I bet the hamburgers are at least a month old
You pay loads of money and it really tastes bad, but you don't wanna admit that you've been had

Wimpy's are shit (Trapper: You'll get diarrhoea), Wimpy's are shit (Trapper:You'll be lucky if you live), Wimpy's'are shit, shit, shit, shit, shit"
