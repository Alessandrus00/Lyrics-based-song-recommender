This is a letter that wasn't sent
A call of arms to fight
Into the dark of night
This is a chance to start again
This is a chance to make amends
To heed the lonely cry
To give it one last try
Oh, I need you by my side
Oh, Tonight we ride
We're lost in time, out of mind
Waiting for a light to shine
There's a chance for us tonight
Let them know; We live for the fight!
Now is the time
This is the time to let you know
This is the only way to go
The key for one more turn
The answer you must learn
This is the time and place my friend
There's no reason to pretend
The moment to speak the truth
This is the time to choose"

(Scatting)

[Verse 1: Dratchface]
I'll spit gargantuan rhymes over a huge-ass beat
It’s the same thing y’all saw me do last week
You’s a cool cat g, do have a seat
Wrapped my psyche in a do-rag and stuck it together with Blu-Tack, see?
The cruel laughs eat away at me
Better pray untilI get a break from some deity
Get away from me, I’m in no state to be in this hellacious dream
I’m happier than when I met Tenacious D

[Outro]
Well it’s something, surely something
High on the bus
None for us, wait and see
And suddenly it all comes back to me
When you need to find your friends
Look no further, just pretend
Live your life through a window
Listen real close you can hear the wind blow
Hey"
