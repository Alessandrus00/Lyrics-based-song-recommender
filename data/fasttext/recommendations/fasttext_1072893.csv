Light ya torches for me!
Let’s burn one down for the monarchy!
(Repeat 2X)

[HOOK 1]
When I say light it – Y’all say UP!
Light it – UP!
Light it – UP!
When I say burn one – Y’all Say Down!
Burn one – DOWN!
Burn one – DOWN!

Heey!
Ok....Heeey!
Ok....Heeey!

[Hook 2:]
If you wanna light it up
Hey! Ignite the torch
Hey! Ignite the torch
Hey! Ignite the torch
If you wanna burn one down
Tonight is yours...yeah!
Tonight is yours...yeah!
Tonight is yours
To make em aware
We true to this
We true to this
We true to this
At any cost, we taking them to edge...what!
To the edge...what!
To the edge
1:
Lemme impart wisdom to these mischievous imps
Indolent simps, pimps and wimps
I’m not impressed by these impotent goons
Impeding with their impetuous coons
If I’m implacable, you must try harder
Cuz we all impatient with these lame impostors
Say hello to the impeccable imperialist
Impugning every challenger inferior with
Impalpable approaches; I get impolite –
When impassioned mavericks bring no insight
They wanna impose? Dem get disposed
If they incessantly interfere with this Infamous Pro

[Refrain 2x]
Light ya torches for me!
Let’s burn one down for the monarchy!


[Verse 2]
Find yourself dismissed from the premises
A bitter distaste you leave behind as you dissipate, disintegrate
Peep the dissertation; keep your distance
So far ahead you might get touched by my descendants
Subsided by none; you’re minor as a subsidiary
Like Henry V, hoping you die from dysentery
Really, I’m sick of you; no discussion I’m dissing you
Dissolve ya district, you pricks are disapproved -
Discontinued; with this, it’s visceral
When it hits, you’re miserable till you feel you’re disillu-sioned
Distraught from the shit you digging through
It’s dismal like swamps, your snakes is living proof
[Repeat HOOK 2]

[Verse 3]
I shook my head when I passed the pastor
When I smelled the bullshit straight from the pasture
I push you to pits; you look too pitiful
That’s how you really fall off; my moves are pivotal
I am the prototype, for the protocol
Not ya lil bitch, don’t call me Toto y’all
Send a ruthless renegade to pulverize
And shake up viewpoints till they’re polarize
P is for pussy and yours is putrid
You’ll get a legion of lesbians puking
Say my words don’t move you, you’re perpetrating
How a dis get ya whole fams percolating?
Growth stunted like you left ya pituitary in the prairie
If you dare me, I’ll blow u up like Pakistanis
Understand me? Or you Pentium-slow wit it
Back and forth like pendulums, I don’t dig it
Politicking with prominent patnaz of promise
Pondering profits that sore like pilots -
Is my own preoccupation
No patience for you hateful pagans
If you ain’t notice, no one rocks ponchos
Precipitating dollars getting played-out pronto
Making it rain? Nigga pull that plug
Increase a nigga’s credit score in the clubs is a plus
Do not propose items that are predisposed
I’m all about inviting folks toward my Black Prose
This is the provenance –
Rocking it from Gotham, around the world, to the Protestants in Providence
[Repeat HOOK 2 + Hook 1]

Gonna try and make it on your own
You're just a kid but you're getting old
Too many years out in the cold
Your daddy doesn't know your name
Your mommy's taking all the blame
She drinks too much and she's never home
Pack your bags and hit the road

Chorus
Now you're a Runaway
Yes, you're a Runaway
Runaway from everything you've known
Runaway, yeah you're a Runaway
Runaway and you're not even grown
Yes, you're a Runaway

You wish the cops would come and say
Gonna' take you home today
But you know the cops will never come
They won't even know you're on the run
So keep your face turned to the wind
Take every shot on the chin
Just when you think you've had enough
That's when it all gets rough
Now you're a Runaway
Yes, you're a Runaway
Runaway from everything you've known
Runaway, yeah you're a Runaway
Runaway from all those years
Runaway from all those tears
Runaway and you're not even grown
Yes, you're a Runaway"
