For new mountain peaks to climb
But when I get to that high top
I'm on level with the ground
All I want is something
That I can hold on to
Something inside tells me
That it might be you

When I get it all
I reach for more

But I can't find entrance
Where is the entry?
Can't find entrance
Where is the entry?
So where is the entry?
Can't find entrance
Where is the entry?

Gold turns to silver in my hand
So I'm gazing at the sky
I really hope my new star
Doesn't turn to dust
You think I'm playing with you
But I'm just afraid to lose
I'm trying hard to find my way
To keep you
I'm always on the lookout
For new mountain peaks to climb
But when I get to that high top

I just can't find entrance"

I've had my many reasons
To take the words out of your breath
The blood right from your veins, and I
Tried to remember what life was like without you
But it never seems to let me forget

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And will you wait on the edge?
And will you wait for me to catch you?

[Chorus]
Through no faults of your own you're bleeding
Do you remember what you want?
I'm so alone with loss and doubts of my own
If you need me, I will be here when you want

[Verse 2]
She had her ways of leaving
She touched her hair then touched his face
Wiped the water from his eyes, and I
Try to picture what life is like without you
But you never seem to let me forget
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And will you wait at the end?
And will you wait for me to catch up?

[Chorus]
Through no faults of your own you're bleeding
Do you remember what you want?
I'm so alone with loss and doubts of my own
If you need me, I will be here when you want

[Bridge]
She says that we're still here
And she says that we're here still
Reassembling the icons, one piece at a time
And we're still here
Dismantling the eyesores, one day at a time
And we're crushing ourselves
One day at a time
One day at a time
One day

[Chorus]
Through no faults of your own you're bleeding
Do you remember what you want?
I'm so alone with loss and doubts of my own
If you need me, I will be here when you want
[Post-Chorus]
Reassembling the icons, oh no
Reassembling the icons, oh no
Reassembling!

[Outro]
I will be here when you want
Reassembling the icons"
