Henry (The Octopus)
The Octopus (The Octopus)
I have a great dance, for you to see

[Chorus: Greg & Henry]
Well, tell us now, Henry, what we all should do
Tell us now, Henry, we want to dance like you
Clap your hands, above your head
And you sway, from side to side
Start to bob, up and down
Now let's spin, around and 'round

Papa don’t shoot no dice he don’t play no cards he say the money’s tight
He say the times are hard

Caught me comin’ in one night after the clock struck three
Caught me comin’ in last night after the clock struck three you been gamblin’
You’ll be the death of me

Gambled in Mexico gambled in New Orleans
Gambled in Mexico down in New Orleans played in every game
In every town between

But a gambler ain’t got no friends whenever his luck is down
Gambler ain't got no friends when his luck is down but when he’s ridin high
They all hang around"
