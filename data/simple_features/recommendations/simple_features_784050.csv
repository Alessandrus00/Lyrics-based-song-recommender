929065,0.7706232822665267,"Johnny was a school boy when he heard his first Beatles song
""Love Me Do"" I think it was and from there it wouldn't take long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock & roll outfit and everything's all right
Well, don't you know?

Johnny told his Mama, ""Hey Mama I'm goin' away
Gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday""
Mama came to the door with a tear drop in her eye
Johnny said, ""Don't cry Mama. Smile and wave goodbye""
Don't you know?

Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know?
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are

Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him play his song
Watching the world go by, surprisin' it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said, hey, I made the big time at last
Don't you know
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know?
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are

Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are

Johnny died one night, died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleepin' tablets by his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind sometimes, you can still hear him play
Don't you know

Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know? Don'tcha
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
Don't you know

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
Don't you know that you are a shoot, a shooting star?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
Don't you know that you are a shooting star?
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)"
