Tells me you'v done something wrong
Something's missing, my lover's gone
And we had such a good time

Money isn't everything
You could have taken anyone
Take my car, my diamond rings
But I don't like my lover gone

Chorus:
Give it back, that love is mine
It should be mine exclusively, yeah!
Give it back, don't waste your time
That love belongs to me
Give it back that love is mine
All Mine, All Mine, All Mine, All Mine

My back was turned, I'd never guess
That you might want to be the next
I've got to say, that isn't cool
I won't give up that easy
I wear suprise upon my sleeve
For all to go and talk about
You took the thing I really need
Now I will not be written out

(chorus)
Can't you see, it's meant for me
And no-one loves me better
No-one's taking what is mine
And we must be together
Now, I want what's all my own
You really shouldn't knock it
In my arms and in my home
'Cos, only I can rock it

Sequins
Pearls
Cars
Girls
Guns
Furs
Diamonds
Money

Want them, Take them Have them, Keep them
Ooh! but hands off, hands off
(chorus)
One thing I just won't do
Is stand here peacefully
And let you walk away now with my baby
Good looks aren't everything
But oh! I like pretty things
And if you touch what's mine
Then I go crazy

All Mine (4x)

Do not waste your time
You know that love is mine
Gonna cut you down to size yeah, yeah, yeah
I only want what's mine
Standing by my side
Don't wanna hear no lies

No, No, No"

Surgeon of the dead
Demented doctor
Forensic eminence
Postmortem raptor
Plunder in the tombs
With nauseous intentions
Dead bodies I exhume

... Surgeon of the dead
... Surgeon of the dead

I am obnoxious
King of the Sick
Insane Mortician
Obscene Pathologist
Depraved and vicious
Vampire of gore
Mortuary abductor
A vulture in the morgue
I am Obnoxious
Idol for the mad
Necrotic butcher
Scavenger of death
Furtive exhumer
Addicted to Rot
Dismembering corpses
Pathology is my job

... Surgeon of the dead
... Surgeon of the dead

Back in the morgue, my mind is getting sicker
The world will puke when I reveal my secrets
Eye for an eye ... Dissected witness
Suffer my wrath before you die in sickness"
