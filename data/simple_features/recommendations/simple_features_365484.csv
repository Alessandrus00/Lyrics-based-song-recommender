Echo through the hallway next to your heart
I can hear the guitar softly strum outside
The window to your room
And every time you come around
I wonder how you dance around the implications,
And they just smile and wave
While they wait to watch you come down again

I can hear the sound of the beating drum
Echo through the hallway next to your heart
Come down again

I can hear the sound of the beating drum
Echo through the hallway next to your heart
Come down again

I can hear the sound of the beating drum
Echo through the hallway next to your heart
Come down again
I can hear the sound of the beating drum
Echo through the hallway next to your heart
Come down again

I can hear the sound"
