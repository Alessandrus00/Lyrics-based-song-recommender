9157,Plain White T's,Haven't Told Her,"

She hit me like a blinding light and I was born
And gravity won't keep my feet down anymore
If you've seen her then you'd understand

An angel in my, the way she moves
She could make your heart beat faster than you knew
She's got a smile that can shake you, vibe that can break you
Eyes that can bring the heat
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(There's just one thing that I haven't told her)

Well, I've been holding back so much I'm in reverse
And buying her that drugstore diamond made it worse
Like the silver on her skin stood for something; a promise

I don't wanna burn out quick if she's the one
Like the fire in between a bullet and the gun
Because she's brighter than Vegas, hotter than Hades
Cool enough to make you freeze
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
I don't wanna lose her
But there's just one thing that I haven't told her

Do you know what you do to me?
I've been captured, waiting for the rapture
Am I just a fool to believe this is it, this is it?

So tell me that you feel the same
Can we say what we wanna say?
'Cause there's just one thing that I haven't told her

I know I love her but I'm tongue tied
I wanna wait until the moment's right
I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)
She's got me higher than a satellite
She makes everything all right
But I don't wanna lose her
(But there's just one thing that I haven't told her)

She hit me like a blinding light and I was born

11723,Akon,Sunny Day,"

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day)...

Block don't stop, always stay hot
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock, then I got popped
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay
It's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
The night they blast my cousin, whoa
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

Been a long day...
On my way to my holy place to pray...
Give thanks for every blessing given to me...
I know there's more to see...more to me...no more living in misery...
Cause this is how I visioned life to beee.....

Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go...
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day....
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away...
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way...
And now I look forward to every day....

Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day...
Everyday....
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...
My sunny day....
Everyday...
A better day...
Welcome to my sunny day...

10385,Logic,Back And Forth,"

[Logic:]
Let me kick rhymes, let me do it slow
Gotta get it every time you ain't fuckin' know
See I'm half white and half negro
So I guess that's why I got a big ego
I got double the talent so I guess I'm too nice
Tryna eat like two dykes cause I'm famished (I'm famished)
Better yet I'm in the depths of Hungary like Budapest
And even when I'm fed I'mma keep going 'til the death
Call me the collar bomba cause I'm blowing minds
Like Osama, that's word to Obama
So much action within my words there ain't no time for drama
Bringing wisdom like Dalai Lama you ain't heard

[C Dot Castro:]
My name is Castro
Hotter than taking shots of Tabasco
I'm the shit, never constipated I got mad flow
Have you wondering why the fuck did he go do that for?
I don't know even my homies say I'm an asshole
My style is so defined cause I'm the definition
Of truth you want proof well then you better listen
I'm never dissin' that's a waste of time
Why waste an amazing rhyme
On them when I can take it and make it mine
I'll make it fine, homie I don't need no one's help
I stay on dimes so you can call me Roosevelt
Yeah, my flow is presidential
I rip it acapella I don't need the instrumental
So try to sleep on me, I leave you like Tom in Seattle
My wordplay is too vicious homie
So you don't wanna scrabble, you don't wanna battle
My shit will leave you without a paddle
Now they all riding me somebody give me a saddle

[Logic:]
My wifey livin' like Oprah
Matter of fact Princess Diana
Cause my first name is S-I-R
And I don't live like no bama
See I execute my emotion through perpetual grammar
Cause my stamina colder than Canada
And hotter than Hades
I spit more than babies infected with rabies
They can't get over the fact
That I'm under their skin like scabies, what it do

I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me
Must've 'bin blind 

She didn't give me a warning 
Said I shouldn't treat you wrong 
But when I woke up this mornin' 
She was gone gone gone 

She said... 
Take me back won't ya
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

She didn't tell me about it 
Am I supposed to read your mind 
You make me get up and shout it 
It's a crime crime crime 

I shoulda seen it coming 
I shoulda seen the signs 
Didn't really think that she needs me 
Must've 'bin blind 

She said...
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'll change my ways 
Take me back won't ya 
Take me back won't ya 
I'm not the same 

Won't ya take me back 
Won't ya take me back

1544,Britney Spears,I've Just Begun (Having My Fun),"

[Bonus Track]

Here is a little story that I made up
So Let's make believe
Four years ago I had a party
that was too much fun for me
Boy there's a sexy guy 
He said he'd give me everything i need
Sometimes I let temptation go too far
and get the best of me
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
The conversation was going no where 'til I turned my hair
He started touching me and kissing me
Like he didn't care
I thought at first I should go home
But then fell asleep in the chair
All I gotta say is
I just wanna have some fun
And I'll do it until I'm done
I'm telling you
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just wanna have a good time
I just wanna be myself
And don't let nobody tell you it's any differantly
I wanna enjoy the sunshine
And do the things that I need
To see what feels good to me
I'm just so crazy
I'm just a crazy kind of girl
I'll tell it to the world
I've just begun having my fun (yeah)
Inside me there's something I found
I wanna shop around
I just begun
Don't wanna settle down
I just begun
I just begun
having my fun
I just begun 
Having my fun, yeah!
